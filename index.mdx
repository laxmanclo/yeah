## Example

These are the foods I like:

- **PIZZA**
- Kebab
- Hamburger

### Example

<Image
  src="/images/example.jpg"
  width="690"
  height="404"
  alt="Image"
/>

I love to code. Here is an example JavaScript code:

```js
console.log("Example")
```

We can also create a table.

| Wrestler                | Origin       |
| ----------------------- | ------------ |
| Mike                    | USA          |
| John                    | UK           |
| Steeve                  | Australia    |
```

### Key Points to Note:
- **MDX Frontmatter**: The frontmatter is properly formatted with the required `---` at the start and end. This section includes metadata like title, description, authors, etc.
- **`<Callout>` Component**: The `Callout` component is correctly placed. Ensure that this component is imported in your MDX environment, otherwise it may cause issues. If it's not a predefined component, you'll need to define it or replace it with something like a simple blockquote.
- **Image Tag**: The `Image` component is written as a self-closing tag (`<Image />`) with the correct attributes (`src`, `width`, `height`, `alt`). If you're using a specific image component (e.g., from Next.js or another MDX plugin), make sure that itâ€™s imported and working correctly.
- **Code Block**: The JavaScript code block is wrapped in triple backticks with a proper language identifier (`js`).
- **Table Formatting**: The table follows the correct markdown table syntax.

This file should be free of any syntax errors and ready to be used for testing purposes, assuming your MDX environment is set up properly with any necessary components (like `Callout` and `Image`) imported and functioning. Let me know if you need further clarification!
